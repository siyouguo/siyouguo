## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a second-year M.S. student at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://dz.sdut.edu.cn/), [Shandong University of Technology (SDUT)](https://www.sdut.edu.cn/). Advised by [Prof. Mingliang Gao (é«˜æ˜Žäº®)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IFEIrUgAAAAJ&hl=en), my research is centered on the critical challenges of misinformation and malicious content detection.

Specifically, I am passionate about developing robust techniques for **deepfake and fake news detection**, with a particular focus on the new complexities and threats emerging in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). My goal is to contribute to a more secure and trustworthy information ecosystem.

Previously, I received the B.Eng degree form SDUT in 2023.
